							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>Since 2002, the Center for Entrepreneurship has been at the forefront of fostering entrepreneurial talent through university and community programs. Over 23 years, the organization has empowered students, partners, and universities to integrate entrepreneurial education across curricula. While the Center has achieved significant success in promoting entrepreneurship, evolving challenges for American students have highlighted the need for dedicated programs that go beyond entrepreneurship, addressing life skills, independence, and career readiness. Recognizing this need, the Center has launched a new nonprofit, <a href="https://coworker365.com">Coworker365</a>, focused exclusively on youth development and student support.</p>

							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Youth Development and Holistic Student Support</h3>

							<ul>
								<li><strong>Self-Management and Life Independence:</strong> Budgeting, time management, personal organization, and housing decisions.</li>
								<li><strong>Social and Relationship Skills:</strong> Communication, networking, conflict resolution, and building meaningful relationships.</li>
								<li><strong>Job Readiness and Career Navigation:</strong> Resume building, interviewing, workplace expectations, and early career planning.</li>
							</ul>
							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>These programs are informed by decades of experience from the Center for Entrepreneurship, including initiatives such as the Dynamic Entrepreneurship Classroom (DEC), Startup Club, and student entrepreneurial skill testing.
