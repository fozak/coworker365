                                Today’s students face a complex world of academic, social, and professional pressures. Research shows that many graduates feel underprepared in key areas such as problem-solving, communication, teamwork, and career navigation. Employers consistently rank <strong>problem-solving skills, ability to work in teams, and effective communication</strong> as the top three attributes they seek in candidates. Beyond academics, students often struggle with managing personal finances, time, stress, and professional relationships, leaving gaps that can hinder career and life success. These challenges demand a comprehensive approach to equip students with practical, real-world skills.
