							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle1'>CFE’s Legacy and the Need for Student-Focused Support
							</h3>
							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>Since 2002, the Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE) has been
								at the forefront of fostering entrepreneurial talent through university and entrepreneur
								programs. Over 23 years, student entrepreneurship support has been an integrated part of
								CFE’s mission. However, student-focused entrepreneurship requires dedicated programs,
								mentorship, funding, and infrastructure beyond standard offerings. Recognizing this, CFE
								has spun off a new non-profit, <a href="https://yoursa.org">YourSA</a>, to concentrate
								exclusively on student programs.</p>

							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle2'>Student Skills Development and Entrepreneurial Readiness
							</h3>
							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>Student entrepreneurship programs overlap substantially
								with broader skills development — including problem-solving, leadership, teamwork,
								creativity, and resilience. Yet only a small fraction of U.S. students intend to start
								businesses immediately after graduation. For example, surveys show that less than 20% of
								students plan to launch a venture soon after finishing college, while confidence in
								entrepreneurial readiness remains low. By establishing YourSA, CFE aims to bridge this
								readiness gap while nurturing transferable skills that benefit all students, regardless
								of whether they launch a business.</p>

							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle3'>What YourSA Will Offer</h3>
							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>YourSA will provide: incubators, accelerators, hackathons,
								mentorship, seed grants, cross-disciplinary collaboration, and post-graduation support.
								Programs will be inclusive of all majors, ensuring that every student with innovative
								potential can access tools and guidance to develop ventures or entrepreneurial
								capabilities.</p>

							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle4'>CFE’s Continued Mission</h3>
							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>Meanwhile, CFE will continue supporting existing
								entrepreneurs and early-stage ventures through flagship programs such as ScaleUp,
								Startup Club, and the ScaleUp Acceleration Program. This strategic focus allows both
								organizations to maximize impact: YourSA addresses student entrepreneurship
								specifically, while CFE sustains its proven support for growth-stage and established
								entrepreneurs.</p>

							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle5'>Impact and Long-Term Vision</h3>
							<p data-semantic='blog-main-text'>By focusing dedicated resources on students, YourSA will
								cultivate entrepreneurial skills, confidence, and networks among emerging innovators.
								Even students who do not start businesses immediately will benefit from transferable
								skills applicable to any career path. This approach strengthens the broader innovation
								ecosystem, builds a culture of entrepreneurial thinking, and generates long-term
								societal and economic impact.</p>

							<h3 data-semantic='blog-subtitle6'>About CFE and YourSA</h3>
							<p data-semantic='blog-additional-text'><strong>Center for Entrepreneurship (CFE)</strong>:
								Established in 2002, CFE supports entrepreneurial ventures at all stages through
								mentorship, acceleration, and programs like ScaleUp and Startup Club. <br>
								<strong>YourSA</strong>: Formed in 2025 as a dedicated non-profit spun off from CFE,
								YourSA focuses exclusively on student entrepreneurship programs, providing students with
								mentorship, resources, funding, and experiential learning opportunities.
